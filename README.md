## ReShop Server Setup:

Necessary Installations to Run:
1. NodeJS (Runtime)
    - Run `npm i` for each package.json (in client, in server)
2. PostgresQL (server setup)
    - Run the database.sql through the psql command line
3. `npm run dev` to start the client server, `nodemon index.ts` to start the server server
    - The server is technically in the client
    - The client interacts with the server separately (REST API)
